# relcode_diag_extension
This is an extension connected to the relcode Fortran program. It reads relcode diagonalisation data and filters out certain states from the spectrum, by user choice. With the filtered spectrum we can form the outgoing wave to investigate how certain parts of the spectrum affect the partial ionisation channels.
